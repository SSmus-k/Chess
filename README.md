# Chess
This is a project i've received. I use python along with some libraries. Again this is just a basic code for Chess.
Python Chess Game ♟️

A 2-player local chess game built in Python using Pygame, featuring move validation, piece highlighting, undo functionality, and smooth graphics.

This project separates game logic (chessengine.py) from the GUI (chessmain.py).

🎮 Features

Two-player local mode (play on the same computer)

Highlight selected pieces and possible moves

Valid move enforcement (basic chess rules)

Undo last move using the Z key

Smooth rendering of pieces and board
